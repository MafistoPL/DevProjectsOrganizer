# Instructions for Codex

- Before implementing any request, provide a brief plan of intended changes (components to add/remove/move, files to touch).
- Ask for confirmation only when the plan is complex (multi-step, architectural, or touching many files).
- For simple actions (e.g., run tests, small styling tweaks), proceed without asking.
- Keep `plan.md` up to date as the spec evolves.
- Keep `BACKLOG.md` up to date with deferred tasks and follow-ups.
- Suggest good moments to commit when the changes form a coherent milestone.
